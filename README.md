## Project Overview
This project is a database system designed based on the provided case study. The project includes an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**, a **Data Dictionary**, the **physical implementation of the database** (SQL code for creating tables and inserting sample data), and a set of **queries** that demonstrate the usability of the system.


## Contents
1. **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
   - The ERD visually represents the relationships between the entities in the system.
   - It was created using [tool used, e.g., MySQL Workbench, dbdiagram.io, Draw.io].

2. **Data Dictionary**
   - Defines all tables, attributes, data types, constraints, and relationships.
   - Ensures data integrity by specifying primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

3. **Physical Database Implementation**
   - **SQL Script:** The database schema is implemented using SQL.
   - **Tables:** Created using `CREATE TABLE` statements with appropriate constraints.
   - **Sample Data:** Inserted using `INSERT INTO` statements for testing.

4. **Database Queries**
   - Five SQL queries were designed to evaluate the database's usability.
   - These queries cover:
     1. Retrieving key business insights.
     2. Filtering and joining relevant data.
     3. Aggregation and statistical analysis.
     4. Searching based on specific conditions.
     5. Demonstrating real-world use cases.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Database Engine**: Ensure you have MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (or any other relevant database system) installed.
2. **Running the SQL Code**:
   - Execute the `create_tables.sql` script to set up the database structure.
   - Run the `insert_data.sql` script to populate the database with sample data.
   - Use the `queries.sql` file to execute and test the predefined queries.

## How to Use
- Load the database schema into your SQL environment.
- Run the queries to analyze the stored data.
- Modify and extend the database as needed for further research and development.

## Future Improvements
- Optimization of indexes for better performance.
- Implementation of stored procedures for automated operations.
- Adding triggers to enforce business rules.
